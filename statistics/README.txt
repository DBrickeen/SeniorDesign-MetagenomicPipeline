As I will remove Picard and simplify the input for the program, the previous README was out of date.
Please disregard previous instructions, and ignore Picard's presence in this project, it will soon be removed.

Current statistics included in this program:

Assembly length
Number of contigs
Number of "clean" windows of a given size (default 100bp).  A "clean" window is defined as one with <50% 'N' base pairs.
Number of "large" contigs.  A "large" contig is one above a given size (default 1000bp).
List of contig sizes
GC% composition
GC% composition of windows of a given size (default 100bp).
NX values (1-100)
Expected number of 'N' pairs per a given number of nucleotides (default 10000bp).
